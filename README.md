# Guest speaker quiz

## Overview
Throughout the course we will have some special guest speakers join us virtually to give you their expertise on a variety of subjects. 

We've asked the speakers to present a bit on their background and what they do but also to talk specifically about topics pertainng the the course curriculum. 

Each speacker has also been asked to impart two *vital* pieces of information to you on how to be a successful ecologist. We are leaving this totally up to them to decide what they think you should know!
